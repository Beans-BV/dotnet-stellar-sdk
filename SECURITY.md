# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are now using the GitHub automated security scanning tool to ensure none
of the dependencies this project relies on are compromised.  If they a vulnerability
is found, the results of that will show up here on GitHub and they will be
identified and resolved as quickly as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability please do not submit it as a public issue. Instead please use the security tab on GitHub to submit the security vulnerability.  This will keep it from being publicly visible and I will discuss the issue with you.  This prevents potential bad actors from using the public issues as a way to discover harmful security issues and use
those as attack vectors.
