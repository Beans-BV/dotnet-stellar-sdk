This project is a full port of the official [Java SDK API](https://github.com/stellar/java-stellar-sdk).  It is fully functional and all of the original Java Unit Tests were also ported and are passing.  

### Todo:
- Nuget Package
- Sample Application

## Documentation
Read the API [Reference Documentation](https://elucidsoft.github.io/dotnetcore-stellar-sdk/) for more information about the API.  For more guidance Stellar.org has documentation that is specific to their [Javascript API](https://www.stellar.org/developers/js-stellar-sdk/reference/) but usage is very similar.
 
## Basic Usage
For some examples on how to use this library, take a look at the [Get Started docs in the developers site](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/create-account.html).
