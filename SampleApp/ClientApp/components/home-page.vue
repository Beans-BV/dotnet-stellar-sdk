        <h3>Stellar Laboratory Sample App</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                The Stellar Laboratory is a set of tools that enables people to try out and learn about the Stellar network. This is a sample application of the <a href="https://www.stellar.org/laboratory/">Official Stellar Laboratory</a>, designed to demonstrate the core concepts
                of using the API.  This will allow you to perform many of the same operations as the original, but will also enable you to step through the code while those operations are running to see how everything works under the hood!
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.stellar.org/laboratory/">Official Stellar Laboratory</a> is a more complete toolset and it is highly recommended to use that for any serious testing.  However, this toolset was designed to mimic the original as closely as possible. If you find a bug
                or an issue, or any discrepancies between this version and the official one please create a <a href="https://github.com/elucidsoft/dotnetcore-stellar-sdk/issues">new issue</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/elucidsoft/dotnetcore-stellar-sdk">GitHub Repository</a>.
