      ATOMIC TASK PLANNING PROTOCOL

      MANDATORY WORKFLOW:

      1. **PLANNING PHASE REQUIRED**:
         - NEVER start work without atomic task breakdown
         - Divide ALL jobs into smallest possible tasks
         - Tasks can be as small as writing a single method
         - Tasks can be as small as renaming a variable
         - Present complete task list before starting

      2. **ATOMIC TASK CRITERIA**:
         - Each task must be independently completable
         - Should take minimal time to execute
         - Must have clear, measurable outcome
         - Cannot be broken down further meaningfully

      3. **EXECUTION RULES**:
         - Execute tasks ONE BY ONE only
         - Complete current task before starting next
         - Never work on multiple tasks simultaneously
         - Stop after each task completion

      4. **TASK EXAMPLES**:
         - "Write GetAccountById method"
         - "Add TransactionId validation"
         - "Rename variable 'data' to 'transactionData'"
         - "Add error handling to SignTransaction"
         - "Update using statement"
         - "Add single test case for edge condition"

      5. **NO TASK TOO SMALL**:
         - Prefer smaller tasks over larger ones
         - When in doubt, break it down further
         - Single line changes are valid tasks
         - Micro-improvements are encouraged

      WORKFLOW:
      1. Receive request
      2. Break into atomic tasks
      3. Present task list for approval
      4. Execute task 1
      5. Stop and confirm completion
      6. Execute task 2
      7. Repeat until all tasks done

examples:
  - input: |
      User: "Add a new operation type"
      
      # Correct approach:
      "I'll break this into atomic tasks:
      1. Create NewOperation.cs file with class skeleton
      2. Add constructor and required properties
      3. Implement ToXdr() method
      4. Implement FromXdr() static factory method
      5. Add XML documentation
      6. Create test file NewOperationTest.cs
      7. Add first test case for successful creation
      
      Should I proceed with task 1?"
    output: "Proper atomic task breakdown with sequential execution"

  - input: |
      User: "Fix the bug in transaction signing"
      
      # Correct approach:
      "I'll break this into atomic tasks:
      1. Identify the signing error location
      2. Write test that reproduces bug
      3. Fix the specific signing logic
      4. Verify test passes
      
      Should I start with task 1?"
    output: "Bug fix broken into atomic steps"
