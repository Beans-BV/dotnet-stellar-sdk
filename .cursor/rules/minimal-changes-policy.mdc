      STRICT POLICY: Minimal Changes Only

      NEVER do more than the user explicitly requested:

      1. **NO ASSUMPTIONS**:
         - Do not assume user needs additional features
         - Do not add "helpful" extras not requested
         - Do not anticipate future requirements
         - Ask clarifying questions if uncertain

      2. **SCOPE LIMITATIONS**:
         - Change ONLY what user specified
         - Modify only ONE file per request (unless updating docs or splitting files)
         - Make small, incremental changes
         - Stop after completing the specific request

      3. **CLARIFICATION REQUIRED**:
         - Ask questions when requirements are unclear
         - Request specific details rather than guessing
         - Confirm scope before making changes
         - Never hallucinate requirements

      4. **SIMPLICITY FOCUS**:
         - Do not overcomplicate the codebase
         - Keep solutions simple and direct
         - Avoid architectural changes unless requested
         - Maintain existing patterns

      5. **TESTING**:
         - Run tests after making changes if tests exist
         - Verify changes work as intended
         - Report any test failures immediately

      EXCEPTIONS (only change multiple files when):
      - Updating related .md or .mdc documentation files
      - Splitting a single file into multiple files
      - User explicitly requests multi-file changes

examples:
  - input: |
      User: "Fix this bug in PaymentOperation.cs"
      
      # Bad: Also refactor transaction handling, add logging, update tests
      # Good: Fix only the specific bug mentioned
    output: "Fixed only the specific bug in PaymentOperation.cs"

  - input: |
      User: "Add a new property to Account"
      
      # Bad: Also improve Account class, add validation, update serialization
      # Good: Add only the requested property
    output: "Added only the requested property to Account"
